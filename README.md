### Hi, I'm Anna ✌️

##### ✔️ Shortly about me
I'm from Ukraine, but now located in Germany. 
I have a Master in Cybersecurity, but found myself more passionate about Web-Development ✨
My interest in programming was triggered in my [University](https://karazin.ua/en), when I was indroduced to a science called steganography - 
the art of hiding secret messages in the images (both raster and vector graphics).

🔥 Now I'm learning Web-Development and want to become a Full-Stack Developer! 🔥

🦾 I'm currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

*You can review my repos with steganography topic, and also I have English publications about my research (list of them is [here](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57208665914))*
